mathlib for rockstar language


Accepting PRs for more idiomatic or functions not done yet.

Functions needed:

1. discrete math: infinity
2. Data Structure: Binary Array with large numbers?
3. Binary: xor 
4. Hyperbolic functions: sinh, cosh, tanh, ..., atanh

Thanks to @DavideFauri for developing most of this library.
